# ML TensorFlow.js Application

This project is a simple machine learning application built using TensorFlow.js. It demonstrates how to load a pre-trained model and make predictions based on user input.

## Project Structure

```
ml-tfjs-app
├── src
│   ├── index.js        # Entry point of the application
│   └── model.js        # Contains the MLModel class for loading and predicting
├── public
│   └── index.html      # Main HTML file for the application
├── package.json        # Configuration file for npm
└── README.md           # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ml-tfjs-app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Open the `public/index.html` file in a web browser to run the application.

## Usage

- The application allows users to input data and receive predictions based on the pre-trained model.
- Modify the `src/model.js` file to change the model or the prediction logic as needed.
